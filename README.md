# Shooter
A project where we as a team of five members convert a game concept document into a game during the development of ten weeks. The weeks are split into three phases, two weeks of pre-production, five weeks of production and three weeks of post-production.

The project is an assignment for the course [Game Design 2: Game Development (5SD064)](http://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/kursplan/?kpid=33553) at [Uppsala University](http://www.uu.se/en).

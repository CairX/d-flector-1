# Collisions
All collision interactions should be done through Unity's built-in system. If different actions need to be taken based on what object is collided with the lookup should be done through the tag-system. This means that all objects and prefabs that need to interact must have a collision-component and a tag.

If both objects that collide must take action their actions should be located within themself. In other words a collision object should NOT be manipulated.
